Software for my Pi I/O Board, part of my home cockpit project for my 
flight simulator.

I'm building a I/O board for the Raspiberry Pi Zero W, which has:

- 192 digital switch inputs (expandable to 256)
- 128 constant current LED outputs, up to 60 mA per channel (expandable to 224)
- 48 digits of 7-segment numeric displays
- 8 characters of 14-segment alphanumeric displays
- 16 servo outputs, 12-bit resolution
- 8 analog inputs, 12-bit resolution
- 24 GPIO pins for future use

This software will interface the hardware with the Flight Simulator, using
the ExtPlane plugin. Inputs will be able to trigger commands and setting
of datarefs, and outputs can be driven by the value of datarefs.

Currently still being developed, not ready for actual use.
