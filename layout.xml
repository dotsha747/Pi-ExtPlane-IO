<!-- here we declare all our switches. Each switch is assigned a name. Switches 
	can be made either from the matrix (given a row and column number) or from 
	a IO line (which requires an IO number). Switches can have two states, CN 
	(connected) or NC (not connected). Upon startup or change of aircraft, the 
	state of each switch is published. After that, the state of the switch is 
	published only when there is a change in value. -->
